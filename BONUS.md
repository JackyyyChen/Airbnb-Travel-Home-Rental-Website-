Dear Sir/Miss

Thank you so much for marking this assignment for me.
I have designed my Airbrb to match mobile mode and website mode.
The main functional are three parts.
The first section is 'MyListingPage' where you can view all the lists you have published,
and if you have already published a list, you can 'Edit', 'Delete',
and 'Delete' from this page. Delete', 'Publish', 'Unpublish', and
'CheckBooking'. When Publish is clicked and published, the Publish button
will automatically change to Unpublish, and clicking Unpublish will change the
publish status of the list back to Unpublish.

The second section is the ListingNewPage, where users can fill in and
publish their own listings, with four categories of options, ChooseType,
HouseAddress, HouseDetails, HouseAmentities and Upload image.

The last section is the Publish list, where users can see their booking
details and all lists. The list with the status of publish can be booking
Only bookings that have been accepted can make a comment on this list.
The bookings that have been declined cannot sent a comment(the comment button is not displayed);
And the bookings that are pending show the comment button as disable.

I have not complete Testing part and when I finished here, I went back and tried to create a brand new account
and post a new list and it came up with 400 (Bad Request).
I have checked all the code in the listingNew section and have not found the problem yet.
I have tried posting the new list several times and sometimes it goes out successfully.
I think the problem is that my listingNew section is too complex and React has asynchronous design.
But I don't have more time to improve this issue. The initialisation form I put in services/config.jsx.
Sorry for the bad response to you of this part and thank you for reading through the above.
I hope you have a good day!

Kind regards
Hanxian(Jacky) Chen
